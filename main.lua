  This game was initialy programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

  This version is built to more closely resemble the NES that the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of resolution, tough in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on modern systems.
